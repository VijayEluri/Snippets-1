## Description
This is compiled by hand (intentionally) with manual deployment (intentionally), just to show how it's done.

## Info
- servlet-api.jar was taken from a Tomcat 8.5.31/lib 
- the model for the web.xml was taken from the examples Tomcat comes with

## Deployment
Copy the ROOT folder into Tomcat's webapps folder
(naming the folder ROOT allows us to bind the application from /)

Start the tomcat and access in browser localhost:8080/hello
